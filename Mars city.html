            Mars Science City would have pressurised biodomes in which ecosystems could be sustained.<br> Dubai Media Office. Sarwat Nasir. Jun 23, 2021. Construction of <br>the world's largest Mars simulation city is to begin in the Dubai desert next year, with completion<br> and the start of operations scheduled for 2024.

      <h2> Dubai's government announced plans for "Mars Science City" at the annual <br>United Arab Emirates (UAE) government meetings in Abu Dhabi, on Sept. 26. The site is set to be the <br>"largest space stimulation city ever built," according to the government's press release<br>, and expected to cost 500 million United Arab Emirates dirhams (approximately $136,124, 800). The <br>project will be lead by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, and developed with global firm Bjarke Ingels Group in collaboration<br> with a team of Emirati scientist, engineer, and designers.</h2>
      <br><h2>The 1.9-million-square-foot campus' walls will be made of 3D-printed sand from the <br>Emirati desert and house a space museum. In it, visitors will find displays on <br>mankind's greatest achievements in space exploration and research, as well as access to numerous educational programs. <br><br></h2>

        <h2>The space will also include laboratories that simulate life on Mars, <br>utilizing 3Dprinting technology and radiation insulation to <br>try and replicate the climate and challenges astronauts would face on the red planet.<br> These amenities will also serve to condition <br>a team of scientists that will take part in a year-long immersion experience involving living in the imitated <br>Martian city, in hopes of providing more insight into real-life conditions and subsequent needs. </h2>
<h2>This new project is part of the UAE's Mars 2117 Project plans—revealed <br>in February of this year—which "aims at its final stage to establish the first inhabitable human settlement<br> in Mars by 2117," according to a press release by the government</h2>

    Mr Al Rais said the city would include several features that would allow scientists from all over the world to carry out <br>research related to the red planet.<br><br>

“The Mars Science City will be a platform where we’re going to have our future space robotics lab, future analog facilities, a <br>habitat and a space sustainability lab,” he said.<br><br>

“We’re currently working on the design. Then we’ll do the construction for the next two years. Hopefully, the city will be ready and<br> operational towards the end of 2024.<br><br>

“We are also working with our partners for identifying the requirements for unique analog facilities as part of the Mars Science <br>City.”<br><br>

An analogue facility is a simulation of the harsh space-like environment, where humans live in isolation for several weeks or months <br>to prepare for future space exploration missions.<br><br>

As part of a different project, MBRSC has shortlisted two Emirati candidates who will travel to Russia at the end of this year to <br>live in a Mars analogue facility for eight months.<br><br>

If analogue facilities are built in Mars Science City, it would give Emirati astronauts easier access to training in such simulated<br> environments.<br><br>

Mr Al Rais said an architect has not yet been selected for the city, but there have been proposals.<br><br>

Architects Bjarke Ingels Group proposed 3D underground buildings and recommended solar energy to power and heat the city.<br><br>

As part of the UAE’s Mars programme, MBRSC also sent the Hope probe into space, to orbit around the Red Planet. The robotic craft is <br>currently capturing scientific data about the planet’s upper and lower atmosphere.
